# Sponsor DPlayer Development

DPlayer is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing.

If you run a business and are using DPlayer in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor DPlayer development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using DPlayer, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in a while :)

You can support DPlayer via donations.

### Recurring Donation
